Temu bot - made by thatonedude-temu

First, you have to open the Github repo (I sent link on discord)

Then, you have to open the Temu Bot application file within the Github page, click the download button on the far right (it says download raw file when you hover your mouse on it)

It will say dangerous file because of a C++ and javascript issue within the application, so just continue downloading if you are on Chrome by just clicking full download history, and then click keep file.

This will download the bot application, which will launch and ask for your permission to use it, click yes and the app will open and you have to add your Temu account to it

Following that, paste your Temu link or code into the text bar

Then, it should start spamming new app users for your account

Enjoy!
